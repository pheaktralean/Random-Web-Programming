# Random Web Programming Exercises

This project is a collection of exercises aimed at improving web development skills using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Node.js**. The exercises cover various aspects of building and structuring websites, making them responsive, using cookies, and hosting them on localhost.

## Exercises Overview

- **Structuring a Website**: 
  - Learn how to organize a website's layout using HTML and CSS.
  - Create a clean structure using semantic HTML tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, etc.

- **Building a Responsive Website**: 
  - Make websites responsive using CSS media queries to adapt to different screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
  
- **Using Cookies**: 
  - Implement functionality to store user information in cookies (e.g., visit history, preferences) and retrieve them in subsequent visits using JavaScript.

- **Hosting on Localhost**: 
  - Host the website locally using Node.js and Express. Run the website on your local machine for testing and development purposes.

- **Making the Website Functional**: 
  - Enhance website interactivity using JavaScript to handle button clicks, form submissions, and DOM manipulation.

- **HTML Form Handling**: 
  - Create forms for user input (e.g., contact forms, registration forms) and handle them using both client-side and server-side processing.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and making the website responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the website.
- **Node.js**: For setting up the server and hosting the website on localhost.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js, used to handle routing and server-side logic.
